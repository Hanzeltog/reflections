What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git will initialize an empty repository. This way Git knows what to do when you run the commands to checkout.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the place where you put the files that you are planning to commit. It gives you a way to specify which files to commit and gives you an easy way to keep
things logically seperated. The working area is where you do the actual work. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can seperate the files you are about to commit in the staging area from the ones you might want to commit sometime later. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be helpful when you want to make experimental changes of which you are not sure if you want to implement them later.
